    <h1>About Me</h1>
<section width="50%">
    <p>My name is Kimberly Owens and I am a 2015 graduate of Elon University.
    Upon graduation I became the Manager of US Southeast Territory at a tech startup in Raleigh, NC and in April 2016 I completed my CAPM certification
    (Certified Associate in Project Management). In June of 2016 I  moved to Investor Relations for a private equity firm in Dallas, TX.
    I have decided to return back to technology because I want to be in an enviroment
    where I am pushed to be constantly growing and learning.</p></section>
